# AI Rules for Educational and Quranic Institutes Management System

## Frontend (FE) Rules
- Use functional components in React for all UI elements.
- Prefer Material-UI for styling; do not use custom CSS or other styling libraries.
- Use Axios for all API requests to communicate with the backend.
- Name variables and functions in camelCase (e.g., `fetchUserData`, `userProfile`).
- Avoid inline styles; apply Material-UI classes or theme-based styling.
- Ensure all components are exported with `export default` or named exports as needed.
- Use ES6+ syntax (e.g., arrow functions, destructuring, template literals).
- Use React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state and side effects.

## Backend (BE) Rules
- Follow RESTful conventions for API routes (e.g., `/api/users/`, `/api/courses/`).
- Use Django ORM for all database queries; do not write raw SQL.
- Name variables and functions in snake_case (e.g., `get_user_profile`, `course_list`).
- Ensure all views are class-based and built with Django REST Framework.
- Use Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication (e.g., token-based or session-based) for securing API endpoints.
- Follow PEP 8 for code style (e.g., 4-space indentation, max 79 characters per line).
- Store sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in environment variables.
- Implement Python logging for key operations (e.g., user login, critical errors).
